 <h4 align="center">Smart Backpack</h4><br />
 
 <p>“Raven” is a smart Backpack which looks exactly like your everyday backpack but is capable of doing a lot more interesting stuff. It has a LCD screen mounted on the bag which will give you basic details like the time and much advance readings like the Radiation Levels. You just have to carry the backpack as you would normally do and the bag will take care of the Rest.
 </p><br />
 
 <p>We live in the Internet of Things era where everything is connected to the internet. So why not your bag? We will connect “Raven” to the internet using the IOT device mounted on the bag and if you’ve got cell reception you even don’t have to look at the LCD on the bag. Simply open up our app on your phone and you’ll be able see a load of readings. The fun thing about this app is that you don’t necessarily need a “Raven” backpack in order to use the app. Once you open up the app you will be able to see the last known weather reading at where you’re standing.

 <p>Following are the Hardware and Software necessities for the project.</p>

 <h4><u>HARDWARE</u></h4>
 
 <ol>
 <li> A Backpack</li>
 <li> Raspberry Pi 2/3</li>
 <li> Power Bank</li>
 <li> BMP O85 Sensor - Barometric Pressure/Temperature/Altitude</li>
 <li> DHT 2 – Humidity Sensor</li>
 <li> MiCS-5525 – Carbon Monoxide Sensor</li>
 <li> MiCS-2710 - Nitrogen Dioxide sensor</li>
 <li> MQ-5 – Methane, LPG, Propane Sensor</li>
 <li> LDR Module – Photoresistor</li>
 <li> Rain Drop Sensor</li>
 <li> Ultrasonic Sensor Module</li>
 <li> Fastrax UP501 GPS Module</li>
 <li> Microphone</li>
 <li> LCD Display Module</li>
 <li> TDA2030A Audio Amplifier</li>
 <li> A small Speaker</li>
 <li> Level Converters, ADC , wires and other peripherals</li>
 </ol>
 
 
 <h4><u>SOFTWARE</u></h4>
 
 <br>
 <p>All the data that are gathered from the above mentioned hardware parts will be sent to a cloud database for storage and we’re planning to build an extremely user friendly android app based on Java FX. As the second stage of our project we have planned to extend the platform compatibility of the app and develop the app to be compatible for iOS and Windows as well.
 </p>
 <p>The App will basically serve all your weather needs plus it can do some additional stuff that will come in handy for everyone.</p>
